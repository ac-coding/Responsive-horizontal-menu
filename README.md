# Responsive-horizontal-menu
A _[really]_ simple responsive horizontal menu ready for any device.

## Technologies

 * HTML
 * CSS3
 * Jquery

The menu uses a simple html list of elements styled as a horizontal list of options managed by a small script to toggle an _active_ class when clicked, horizontal scroll and animation to the selection pointer.

## Responsivity

The menu has been **built to allow any screen size/device** without changes on the styling. This is based on a mask that hide the overflowed list of elements. No more dropdown menus for mobiles.
